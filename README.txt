libdll is a small and portable, yet feature rich doubly linked list
implementation in C. 

this library has been written with Linux as a target operating system in mind
but it'll be easy to port to something else.

For install instructions have a look at INSTALL.txt.

API documentation in HTML format can be found in the doc directory. Also,
test/dll_testcase.c should give you a pretty good impression of how to use the
library.
